                <h3>Answer:</h3>
                <p>I specialize in web development, front-end design, and user experience (UX) design. I also offer
                    services in responsive design, custom website development, SEO optimization, and content management
                    system (CMS) integration. Whether you're looking for a brand-new website, a redesign, or specific

                <h1>2. What technologies do you use?</h1>
                <h3>Answer:</h3>
                <p>I work with a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and PHP. I
                    also have experience with front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, as well as CMS
                    platforms such as WordPress and Joomla. I’m always learning new tools and keeping up with the latest
                    industry trends to ensure my projects are modern and efficient.</p>

                <h1>3. How do I get started working with you?</h1>
                <h3>Answer:</h3>
                <p>To get started, simply reach out to me via the contact form or email me directly with details about
                    your project. After that, we can schedule a consultation chat to discuss your needs, goals, and
                    timeline. I’ll provide a detailed proposal and once we’re aligned, we can start working on your
                    project.</p>
                <hr>

                <h1>4. Do you offer ongoing support after the project is complete?</h1>
                <h3>Answer:</h3>

                <p>Yes, I offer ongoing support for all the projects I work on. Whether you need updates,
                    troubleshooting, or additional features down the line, I can help. I provide maintenance packages
                    that include regular updates, security checks, and performance optimizations.</p>
                <hr>

                <h1>5. How long does it take to complete a project?</h1>
                <h3>Answer:</h3>

                <p>The timeline for completing a project depends on the complexity and scope of the work. Typically,
                    smaller websites may take a few weeks, while larger, more custom projects may take a few months.
                    During our initial consultation, I will provide you with an estimated timeline and keep you updated
                    throughout the development process.</p>
                <hr>

                <h1>6. What is the process for making revisions to my project?</h1>
                <h3>Answer:</h3>

                <p>I work closely with clients to ensure they’re happy with the final product. Revisions are part of the
                    process, and I encourage feedback. During the project, I’ll deliver milestones, and after each one,
                    we can review and make any changes necessary. I ensure clear communication throughout so that the
                    project evolves to meet your expectations.</p>
